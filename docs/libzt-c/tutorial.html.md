Encrypted P2P connections for your app or service.

This is a multi-part guide on how to use the ZeroTier SDK. It generally progresses from beginner topics to advanced topics and is meant to be read linearly. We will start by creating a simple [pingable node](#pingable-node) whilst skipping over most of the finer details. Then we'll move on to a full [client-server socket application](#client-and-server) where we will take the occasional tangent to learn more about how all of this works. Source code for the examples can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/zerotier/libzt/tree/master/examples">libzt/examples</a>. For API reference documentation see the sidebar.

:::note Latest news

For the purposes of this guide it is recommended that you first [create an account](https://my.zerotier.com) and a private network to test on, but it is not strictly necessary if you're comfortable joining public networks or setting up your own network controller.

## Pingable Node

To begin, we will set up a node, join to your network, assign it a globally-available static IPv4 and/or IPv6 address and ping it. We'll be skipping over a lot of details in this first example, we'll cover those in the next example.

### Starting a node

Starting a node like this will generate a new `identity` automatically, but let's not worry about that yet.

<Tabs

  groupId="language-examples"
  values={[
    { label: "C/C++", value: "c", },

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java">

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>





Before we take any further action we need to know when the node has successfully come online. There are [a couple of ways to do this](#events) but for now we will use the method that requires the least effort:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="c"
  groupId="language-examples"
  values={[
    { label: "C/C++", value: "c", },
    { label: "Rust", value: "rust" },
    { label: "Python", value: "python" },
    { label: "C#", value: "csharp" },
    { label: "Java", value: "java" }
  ]}>

<TabItem value="c">

```c
while (! zts_node_is_online()) {
    zts_util_delay(1000);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python">

```python

  time.sleep(1)

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
// Coming soon
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java">

```java
// Coming soon
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


Once we've broken from this loop we can be confident that the node has a valid identity and has made contact with at least one root server. At this point let's print our identity:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="c"
  groupId="language-examples"
  values={[
    { label: "C/C++", value: "c", },
    { label: "Rust", value: "rust" },

    { label: "C#", value: "csharp" },
    { label: "Java", value: "java" }

### Join a network

Now we're ready to make a network join request!

<Tabs
  defaultValue="c"
  groupId="language-examples"
  values={[
    { label: "C/C++", value: "c", },
    { label: "Rust", value: "rust" },
    { label: "Python", value: "python" },
    { label: "C#", value: "csharp" },
    { label: "Java", value: "java" }
  ]}>

<TabItem value="c">

```c
if (zts_net_join(0x1234567890abcdef) != ZTS_ERR_OK) {
    return -1; // Failure
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python">

```python
node.net_join(0x1234567890abcdef)
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust">

```rust
// Coming soon
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
// Coming soon
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java">

```java
// Coming soon
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The network join request will contact the network controller and if the network is `public` your node will be allowed to join immediately. If however the network is `private` the node will not be allowed to join until the network operator authorizes the node. A node is not assigned an IP address until it has successfully joined the network. This process usually takes a few seconds, thus our application must wait until the network config is received and we've been assigned an address.

Again, we will use a rather crude wait loop but there are event-based methods for accomplishing this that we will discuss later.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="c"
  groupId="language-examples"
  values={[
    { label: "C/C++", value: "c", },
    { label: "Rust", value: "rust" },

    { label: "C#", value: "csharp" },
    { label: "Java", value: "java" }
  ]}>

<TabItem value="c">

```c
while (! zts_net_transport_is_ready(net_id)) {
    zts_util_delay(1000);
}
```

<TabItem value="java">

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The transport readiness check above essentially just makes sure we have been authorized on the network and that we also have an assigned address and a managed route.

Now we can check for an address of a specific family type (IPv4 or IPv6). In our case we'll just check for an IPv4 address:

<Tabs defaultValue="c" groupId="language-examples"
  values={[
    { label: "C/C++", value: "c", },
    { label: "Rust", value: "rust" },

    { label: "Java", value: "java" }
  ]}>

<TabItem value="c">

```c
while (! (err = zts_addr_is_assigned(net_id, ZTS_AF_INET))) {
    zts_util_delay(1000);
}

### Getting your IP address

:::note

As of current, only one address of each family type may be assigned to a libzt node at any time. It is planned to remove this limitation in future versions

:::

Now we can print the address assigned by this network and wait for incoming traffic:

zts_addr_get_str(net_id, ZTS_AF_INET, ipstr, ZTS_IP_MAX_STR_LEN);
printf("Ping me at %s\n", net_id, ipstr);

// Do network stuff!
// zts_bsd_socket, zts_bsd_connect, etc

while (1) {
    zts_util_delay(500);   // Idle indefinitely

From another machine (or the same machine, whatever you're into), use our regular client `zerotier-one` to join the same network and ping the address displayed by your new node above. You should see some jittery initial responses as our transport-triggered link is established and then once a VL2 P2P connection is established the response time will stabilize.

Congratulations you've just done something cool I guess. Ready for something with sockets?

Oh crap, I forgot. We need to stop the node when we're done:

## Client and Server

ZeroTier provides a socket interface that is idiomatic to each supported language.

## Using sockets

:::note

ZeroTier sockets can be controlled via `zts_bsd_` functions that operate nearly identically to normal BSD-style sockets, and `zts_` functions that provide simplified arguments and reduce the need to use things like `struct sockaddr`. These functions can be used on the same socket interchangeably without issue. Furthermore, the `zts_node_` and `zts_net_` functions control the node and networks respectively.

:::caution

You should keep your identity files safe and unique! If anyone gets a copy of these files they can impersonate your node. And if you run two nodes with the same identities simultaneously you will have a bad day.

### Changing network settings






























## Node Initialization

Initialization is entirely optional but it is important to understand the options available. These functions can only be called *before* starting your node. They don't do much except instruct your node on how to operate after it starts.

The first option we should consider is how we'd like to generate or load our node's `identity`. Every node needs an identity, it's a cryptographic address that you'll use when authorizing the node on your private network. Don't worry though, you'll still use an IP address to talk to your node once joined. You have a few mutually-exclusive options:

There are a few other initialization functions to customize the behavior of your node which must be called before `zts_node_start()`:

```c
zts_init_port(int port); // Bind to specific port
zts_init_callback(&my_event_handler); // Set callback function
zts_start();
...
```
























































































































































































































































































## Errors

On success a function typically will return `ZTS_ERR_OK` or a positive value (possibly indicating the number of bytes sent or received.) On failure a function typically will return a negative number or possibly a `NULL` pointer, though this may vary somewhat depending on the language binding you're using.

```c
ZTS_ERR_OK        =  0, // No error
ZTS_ERR_SOCKET    = -1, // Socket error, see zts_errno
ZTS_ERR_SERVICE   = -2, // The node service experienced a problem
ZTS_ERR_ARG       = -3, // Invalid argument
ZTS_ERR_NO_RESULT = -4, // No result (not necessarily an error)
ZTS_ERR_GENERAL   = -5  // Consider filing a bug report
```
In the event of a failure from a socket call `zts_errno` will be set to a value that offers additional context. These values are defined as `zts_errno_t` in [include/ZeroTierSockets.h](https://github.com/zerotier/libzt/blob/master/include/ZeroTierSockets.h). This is accessible via the following:

:::note

For Android/Java (or similar) which use JNI, the socket API's error codes are negative values encoded in the return values of function calls.

## Events

The SDK can send your application notifications when certain internal states are reached. Examples of this may be when the node comes online or when a new IP address is assigned. This is set up during the initialization phase before starting your node:

        printf("Node ID is %llx\n", msg->node->node_id);

:::note C API

In each message a pointer to a `zts_event_msg_t` object is provided. This structure contains pointers to yet more structures. Each event type has its own special structure with additional relevant data included. For instance, a network event will have a valid pointer set to `msg->network` that contains things like the network ID, its type, status, assigned addresses, multicast subscriptions, etc.

This additional information is not available in all language bindings and you may need to use the sequential-style functions to get the information you need.
:::







## Common issues

- If you have started a node but have not received a `ZTS_EVENT_NODE_ONLINE`:
  - You may need to view our [Router Config Tips](https://zerotier.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/6815768/Router+Configuration+Tips) knowledge base article. Sometimes this is due to firewall/NAT settings.

- If you have received a `ZTS_EVENT_NODE_ONLINE` event and attempted to join a network but do not see your node ID in the network panel on [my.zerotier.com](my.zerotier.com) after some time:
  - You may have typed in your network ID incorrectly.
  - Used an improper integer representation for your network ID (e.g. `int` instead of `uint64_t`).

- If you are unable to reliably connect to peers:
  - You should first read the section on [Connecting and communicating with peers](#connecting-and-communicating-with-peers).
  - If the previous step doesn't help move onto our knowledge base article [Router Config Tips](https://zerotier.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/6815768/Router+Configuration+Tips). Sometimes this can be a transport-triggered link issue, and sometimes it can be a firewall/NAT issue.





## API Structure

ZeroTier is written in C++ but exposes two C APIs at different abstraction levels for different purposes. First, there is the Core API which allows you to control a raw node that can securely move Ethernet frames. The core API is for those who need transport options below the socket layer. Second, there is a Socket API (this document). The socket API provides a familiar socket interface and a suite of convenient control functions. This API is recommended for most applications.

## Technical notes

### Thread model

Both the **socket** and **control** interfaces are thread-safe but are implemented differently. The socket interface is implemented using a relatively performant core locking mechanism in lwIP. This can be disabled if you know what you're doing. The control interface is implemented by a single coarse-grained lock. This lock is not a performance bottleneck since it only applies to functions that manipulate the ZeroTier service and are called infrequently. Callback events are generated by a separate thread and are independent from the rest of the API's internal locking mechanism. Not returning from a callback event won't impact the rest of the API but it will prevent your application from receiving future events so it is in your application's best interest to perform as little work as possible in the callback function and promptly return control back to ZeroTier.

:::note

Internally, `libzt` will spawn a number of threads for various purposes: a thread for the core service, a thread for the network stack, a low priority thread to process callback events, and a thread for each network joined. The vast majority of work is performed by the core service and stack threads.

:::

### Versioning

:::info

Each component of a libzt distribution uses [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org).

:::

The [ZeroTier](https://github.com/zerotier/zerotierone) core, the libzt service, and any included language wrapper each have their own semantic versions that are loosely-coupled to each other in only one direction. libzt's `major` and `minor` version is only updated to match ZeroTier when the core version referenced via submodule is updated. Likewise, each language wrapper's version is only updated to match libzt when the version of libzt changes. Note, however that the version of libzt can change even when its core ZeroTier version does not and the same applies to libzt's wrappers! This versioning scheme is only enforced from `1.4.0` onward.

For instance:

 - When released, libzt `1.4.0` will be based on ZeroTier `1.4.X`, all language wrappers would also be brought to version `1.4.0`. If a language wrapper requires an update to fix some issue we may bump the wrapper version to `1.4.1` but both libzt and ZeroTier will remain at their respective current versions. Likewise for the dependency between libzt and ZeroTier. This method was chosen over using version suffixes like `1.4.0-r1` because some semantic versioning clients may handle that version as a pre-release and prefer to use `1.4.0`.
























## Debugging

If you're experiencing odd behavior or something that looks like a bug I would suggest first reading and understanding the following sections:

* [Common pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)
* [API compatibility with host OS](#api-compatibility-with-host-os)
* [Thread model](#thread-model)

If the information in those sections hasn't helped, there are a couple of ways to get debug traces out of various parts of the library.

1) Build the library in debug mode with `make host_debug`. This will prevent the stripping of debug symbols from the library and will enable basic output traces from libzt.

2) If you believe your problem is in the network stack you can manually enable debug traces for individual modules in src/lwipopts.h. Toggle the `*_DEBUG` types from `LWIP_DBG_OFF` to `LWIP_DBG_ON`. And then rebuild. This will come with a significant performance cost.

3) Enabling network stack statistics. This is useful if you want to monitor the stack's receipt and handling of traffic as well as internal things like memory allocations and cache hits. Protocol and service statistics are available in debug builds of `libzt`. These statistics are detailed fully in the section of `include/ZeroTierSockets.h` that is guarded by `LWIP_STATS`.

```c
struct zts_stats_proto stats;
if (zts_get_protocol_stats(ZTS_STATS_PROTOCOL_ICMP, &stats) == ZTS_ERR_OK) {
    printf("icmp.recv=%d\n", stats.recv); // Count of received pings
}
if (zts_get_protocol_stats(ZTS_STATS_PROTOCOL_TCP, &stats) == ZTS_ERR_OK) {
    printf("tcp.drop=%d\n", stats.drop); // Count of dropped TCP packets
}
```

4) There are a series of additional events which can signal whether the network stack or its virtual network interfaces have been set up properly. See `ZTS_EVENT_STACK_*` and `ZTS_EVENT_NETIF_*`.











## Self-hosting

Can I run my own infrastructure independently from ZeroTier?

:::tip Yes

We provide ways for your app or enterprise to function independently from any of our services.

:::

We expend considerable effort designing and maintaining a robust and globally available constellation of root servers and redundant network controllers but we understand that security practices may require you to function independently from our infrastructure. For this reason we try to make it as easy as possible to set up your own infrastructure: See [here](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/tree/master/controller) to learn more about how to set up your own network controller, and [here](https://www.zerotier.com/manual/#4_4) to learn more about setting up your own roots.
