## How ZeroTier Pricing Works

We offer a free tier to anyone who wants to try out ZeroTier to get remote access to a local network, host / join a gaming network, run a small homelab, or evaluate the platform. Our free option allows for a limited number of devices, and is intended for testing, non-commercial, and personal use.

Once you're ready to use ZeroTier for your business, or need to deploy larger networks, we offer two main pricing options:

- Professional allows you to add "device packs" that you can add and remove from your account at any time. It also includes business-centric features such as SSO. If you use Central, you can upgrade to a Professional plan at any time from your [account settings page](https://my.zerotier.com/account).
- Commercial offers volume discounts for larger deployments, as well as annual pricing and other business-friendly payment options. To enroll in a Commercial plan, just [contact our sales team](mailto@sales@zerotier.com).

No matter which plan you choose, ZeroTier pricing is based on the number of devices authorized to access your networks. That means that if the same device is connected to multiple networks, it only counts once.
