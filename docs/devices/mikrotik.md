MikroTik
=====

MikroTik maintains a [ZeroTier package](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/ZeroTier) for their line of routers. This page is intended to eventually function as a complement to the official MikroTik documentation. If you're new to ZeroTier we'd recommend reading our [Getting Started Guide](https://zerotier.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/8454145/Getting+Started+with+ZeroTier) as well. Other useful resources include [this post on the MikroTik Forums](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?p=935058&hilit=zerotier#p914222). You can view MikroTik's original announcement and discussion [here](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=178063).
