OPNsense
=====

# OPNSense
[OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) is an open source, easy-to-use and easy-to-build HardenedBSD based firewall and routing platform.
They maintain a ZeroTier [package](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/zerotier.html).

If you're using more than one OPNsense router with ZeroTier for a site-to-site style VPN, see this [discussion](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/779#issuecomment-767198156) for a workaround for a common issue.
