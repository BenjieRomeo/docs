Self Hosting
======
There are 2 types of ZeroTier infrastructure: roots and controllers. If you're looking to "self host zerotier", read on. 


## Network Controllers
Controllers handle [Virtual Layer 2](../zerotier/manual.md#22vl2theethernetvirtualizationlayeraname2_2a). No traffic is handled by controllers. 

ZeroTier Inc runs controllers with a web UI and API at [ZeroTier Central](https://my.zerotier.com).

You can [self-host controllers](/self-hosting/network-controllers), but we don't currently offer the web UI for self-hosting. You'll have to use the json api.

The controller is open-source. Please check the [license](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). It's built in to the zerotier-one binary. 


## Roots
Roots handle [Virtual Layer 1](../zerotier/manual.md#211networktopologyandpeerdiscoveryaname2_1_1a). 
ZeroTier Inc hosts the roots. 

Setup for peer to peer connections happen via the roots. If p2p connections can't be made, traffic is "relayed" through these roots.

Remember: All traffic is end-to-end encrypted. The roots can't read anything that passes through them. 

You can [host your own roots](/zerotier/moons) (previously called "moons") in addition to ZeroTier's, but we can't provide support for removing ZeroTier's roots (unless you are a large enterprise customer).
The mobile apps don't support custom roots.

If you are using a custom root setup, your nodes won't be able to find standard nodes. If you want to add additional roots and still talk to standard nodes, see [moons](/zerotier/moons).
