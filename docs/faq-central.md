### Can I move or transfer my network(s) to another user?

When you join an [Organization](./organizations.md), all of your networks are transferred to the Organization.

Other than that, there is no way to transfer individual networks between accounts.

#### To change your Organization Owner:

What you can do is change the email address of your account to a different address. From the account page, select “Manage Account” then “Personal Info”.  From there you can change the email address. After changing, please log out and log back in.

Note: This email address must not already have a ZeroTier Central account.

Many users prefer to use something like “billing” or “admin” `@example.com` for their organization owner email account and then invite `alice@example.com` and `bob@example.com` as network admins.
