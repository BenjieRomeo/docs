title: Audit of Protocol
---

In March 2020 we worked with `@trailofbits` to audit our protocol and cryptographic designs for ZeroTier 2.0. As one of its subjects is in our just-released beta, we are ready to make our first preliminary audit public [here](https://zerotier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ZeroTier-Protocol-Review-Summary.pdf) A full code audit is coming after 2.0.
