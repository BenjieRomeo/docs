You’ve subscribed to my.zerotier.com and want your coworkers to also have the benefits of a Pro account.

Add them to your Organization by going to my.zerotier.com/account

Create an invite by typing in an email address

We will email them the link. You can also paste it into your company chat.

Once they accept the invite, they can be added as Admins to individual networks.

### Removing Admins from the Organization

You can click the “remove” button next to their name in the list of admins. They will lose Admin access to the organizations networks.

### Change the Organization owner

Consider using a general email address like “<billing@example.com>” when you sign up.

Can I move or transfer my network(s) to another user?
